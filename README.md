# keshavprojects

welcome to keshav projects! a repository full of the best projects that i've done.
you may download these projects and make them better, they are of free use.

**if a project does not work:**

- open the project in your favourite IDE (example: VS code)
- delete all the files that have errors
- write the files again, without errors
- if it does not work still, then I don't know (don't ask me and don't flood me with issues.)
- And I hope all of these actually work because I tested them
  (If you are not in windows you need to change the paths are that are referred in the code)

*I also modified small portions of some programs before I uploaded them on github (I did not test the modified versions.)*

thank you for your time.

and also before you leave:
**dont run my flask apps in production PLEASE (unless you really wish to run an app with zero security other than prevention from SQL injections)**
